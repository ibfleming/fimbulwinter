# ─── Specific Creature Overrides ───

# Serpent: Cap stars and remove Armored/Quick -- these make ocean travel unfun rather than challenging.
# Serpents already hit hard; Armored Serpent while sailing would be genuinely broken.
Serpent:
  stars:
    0: [25, 5]
    1: [30, 10, 3]
    2: [30, 12, 5, 1]
  effect:
    Armored: 0
    Quick: 0

# Deathsquito: Slightly reduce movement speed -- 0.9x makes them still deadly but dodgeable.
# Full speed starred Deathsquitos with CLLC effects would be genuinely unfair.
Deathsquito:
  movement speed: 0.9

# Tamed animals: Boost health by 20% so they survive better with harder creatures around.
# No damage boost -- tames shouldn't be your primary DPS.
Tamed Animals:
  tamed:
    health: 1.2

# ─── Boss Tuning ───
# Eikthyr: Gate the Mending affix behind world level 1+. A regenerating first boss is unfair for fresh starts.
Eikthyr:
  affix:
    0:
      Mending: [8, 0]
    1:
      Mending: [12]

# The Elder: Increase bow damage taken slightly -- reward archers who kite properly.
The Elder:
  damage taken:
    Bows: 1.1

# Moder: Reduce elemental damage taken by 5% -- she already deals heavy frost, don't let infusions stack too hard.
Moder:
  damage taken:
    Elemental: 0.95
